  		Electricity, what we use to power our favorite electronics such as laptops, tablets, your friend's big fat gigantic tv screen. What is it exactly, intuitively you may think it is the flow of electrical energy.
  		<div>
  		  In simple terms, electricity is the product of the flow of electrons. Electricity can be used power electronics.

  		  But, as we go deeper, electricity is produced when a current is complete. You need a supplier and an actually complete circuit in order for electricity to travel and do its work.
  		  This is because the electrons needs to transfer back to the source. As we can see, electricity is a lot more than what meets the eye.

  	    When you hear the word magnetism, you may think of magnets and attraction. You may already know the opposite pole attracts and same poles repels.

  	  <div style="color:blue;" class="text-reactive1 content-text">
  	    But, what really happens?
  	    Well turns out, there are fields called electric fields where positvely/negatively charge objects will experience it's own field of attraction and repel.
  	    So to reiterate, magnets are one of the most fascinating things in Physics because of the fields and the complex concepts associated with it.
